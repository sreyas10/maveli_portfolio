        <p>Mahabali, often referred to as King Mahabali, is a legendary and central figure in Hindu mythology. He is celebrated for his virtuous and benevolent rule as an Asura (demon) king and is prominently featured in the Hindu festival of Onam, primarily observed in the Indian state of Kerala.</p>

        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>Mahabali was born to the Asura (demon) king Virochana and Queen Devamba. He belonged to the noble lineage of the Asuras and inherited his father's kingdom. However, unlike many Asura kings known for their malevolence, Mahabali was known for his righteousness, generosity, and commitment to the welfare of his subjects.</p>

        <h3>Encounter with Lord Vishnu:</h3>
        <p>In a legendary episode, Mahabali conducted a grand sacrifice, and Lord Vishnu appeared before him in the form of a dwarf Brahmin named Vamana. The dwarf Brahmin asked for three paces of land. Mahabali, known for his generosity, granted the request. However, Vamana transformed into a gigantic form and covered the entire universe in three steps. In doing so, he pushed Mahabali deep into the netherworld.</p>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Legacy:</h3>
        <p>Despite his banishment, Mahabali's devotion and generosity were so highly regarded that Lord Vishnu granted him a boon. Mahabali was allowed to visit his kingdom and people once a year during the Onam festival, symbolizing his continued bond with his people.</p>
